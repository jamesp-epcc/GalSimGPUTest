# GalSim Test

This is a simple C++ test case for testing the OpenMP Target Offload accelerated
version of GalSim on Perlmutter.

There is also a Makefile (`Makefile_GalSim.perlmutter`) for building the C++
GalSim library using NVCC on Perlmutter as I could not get this to work using the
normal GalSim build system.
